Generated Haiku:
Mind's still waters calm
Reflecting the Self within
Peaceful darkness found

Commentary:
This haiku distills the essence of meditation into a poignant paradox: that true peace and clarity arise not from external sources, but from embracing the stillness and darkness of the Self. In this sense, it challenges the notion of seeking external validation or enlightenment, instead revealing that inner transformation is the only true catalyst for liberation. The haiku's mirror-like imagery serves as a powerful metaphor for the introspective journey, reflecting back to us our own depths of consciousness.
